  abstract = {Having a clean product catalog and keeping it complying with the standards of the industry is one of the primary concerns of e-commerce companies. Integrating product data from multiple providers confronts the companies with a challenging issue: duplicate product records. Since it is possible to describe a product with a variety of different words, images and attributes, detecting duplicate product records is a difficult task to overcome. In this work, a novel duplicate record detection engine is proposed for an e-commerce company, Hepsiburada. The engine is developed based on a real-world dataset. In order to build a training set we use text similarity and domain-specific distance metrics for generating candidate duplicate product pairs which are then labeled by human experts. We performed extensive feature engineering and state-of-the-art classification models to determine whether any two products are duplicated or not. The experimental results show that our engine is able to detect duplicate product records with high precision and outperforms the accuracy of non-adaptive methodologies.},

  abstract = {With the ever increasing volume of data, data quality problems abound. Multiple, yet different representations of the same real-world objects in data, duplicates, are one of the most intriguing data quality problems. The effects of such duplicates are detrimental; for instance, bank customers can obtain duplicate identities, inventory levels are monitored incorrectly, catalogs are mailed multiple times to the same household, etc. Automatically detecting duplicates is difficult: First, duplicate representations are usually not identical but slightly differ in their values. Second, in principle all pairs of records should be compared, which is infeasible for large volumes of data. This lecture examines closely the two main components to overcome these difficulties: (i) Similarity measures are used to automatically identify duplicates when comparing two records. Well-chosen similarity measures improve the effectiveness of duplicate detection. (ii) Algorithms are developed to perform on very large volumes of data in search for duplicates. Well-designed algorithms improve the efficiency of duplicate detection. Finally, we discuss methods to evaluate the success of duplicate detection.

Extended methods provide estimates of false match rates in both unsupervised and, with greater accuracy, in semi‐supervised situations.
